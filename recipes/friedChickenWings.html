        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
            <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
